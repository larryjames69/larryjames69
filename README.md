### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ I'm just a programmer that started his journey in 2019 with C# and WinForms.
- ðŸŒ± I've made some contributions to the [Reqwest HTTP Crate](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest).
- âš¡ Besides programming & contributing to open source I enjoy to look into the inner workings of software.
- ðŸ¦€ I began writing software in the Rust systems programming language in early October 2021.
- ðŸ’¬ You can get in touch with me by email at [larryjames69@pm.me](mailto:larryjames69@pm.me).

### Repositories
#### ðŸŒŸ If you are interested in any of my projects, you can checkout my repositories. I'm really not a fan of proprietary software, and most of my projects are licensed under a FOSS license.

> If you would like to support my work in open-source or in general, consider submitting pull requests or sponsoring my projects. Alternatively, get in touch with me via [email](mailto:larryjames69@pm.me).
